Newspress automatically syndicates posts made to your Wordpress blog directly to Newstex without having to worry about RSS feeds.


== Description ==

Newspress automatically syndicates posts made to your Wordpress blog directly to Newstex without having to worry about RSS
feeds. It's as simple as installing the plugin and entering your Newstex username/password.

Once your credentials are set up, every post you add/edit will automatically be sent to Newstex and processed.

After installing the plugin and entering your credentials, it is a good idea to edit an old post or create a new test post
in order to ensure that the plugin is working properly.


== Installation ==

1. Put the 'newspress' folder in the wp-content/plugins folder
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Under the Settings menu, select Newspress
1. Enter your Newstex username/password
1. It is recommended that you then edit an old post/create a new post and then check that it publishes properly
1. You're done, continue using Wordpress as you would normally and now your posts will be published to Newstex

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Newstex account before sending stories? =

Yes, because we need your username/password to determine where to publish the story to.

= I don't see my stories publishing, is something wrong? =

Typically it takes a few minutes for Newstex to process a post from Wordpress. If the post doesn't show up in five or ten minutes:
1. Check that your username/password are correct.
1. Try editing the post and re-saving it.
1. Contact support [a t] newstex [d o t] com with your concerns.
